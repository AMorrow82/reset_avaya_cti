# Reset Avaya and CTI script

Script automatically quits Avaya and CTI processes with task manager and restarts them upon execution.
Then, prompts you to log back into each app.

**Remember, you must log into Avaya FIRST. Then CTI after.**

1. Save the bat file somewhere _convienient_, like your **desktop**.

2. Double click the bat file whenever you wish to reset Avaya and CTI.
